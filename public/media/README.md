## **THE MEDIA IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE REPOSITORY!**

***If you wish to obtain access to the media...***

 1. Get the MEGAsync application from their website (https://mega.nz/sync)
 2. Delete this README (this step may be optional, but to avoid possible weirdness with the files, just do it)
 3. Set up the MEGAsync app to only sync the media folder on Mega to this local media folder
 4. You're good to go!
